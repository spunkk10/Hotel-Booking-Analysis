***Hotel Booking Analysis***

**Objective:**

This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to understand the factors contributing to high cancellation rates in City Hotels and Resort Hotels. The findings will help optimize pricing strategies, improve occupancy rates, and enhance revenue management.


**Business Problem:**

The hospitality industry has been facing a significant challenge due to high cancellation rates, impacting revenue generation and operational efficiency. This study focuses on identifying key factors influencing cancellations and provides data-driven recommendations to mitigate revenue loss.


**Key Findings:**

1)High Cancellation Rates: Approximately 37% of total reservations are canceled, significantly affecting revenue.
2)Pricing Influence: Higher room rates correlate with increased cancellations. Offering dynamic pricing strategies and discounts can mitigate this issue.
3)Booking Trends: City Hotels receive more bookings than Resort Hotels, likely due to pricing differences and seasonal demand fluctuations.
4)Peak Cancellation Periods: The highest number of cancellations occur in January, while August experiences the most bookings. Targeted marketing and pricing strategies can be implemented accordingly.
5)Booking Sources: Around 46% of reservations come through online travel agencies, with direct bookings accounting for only 4%, indicating a dependency on third-party platforms.
6)Geographic Trends: Portugal accounts for the highest number of cancellations, suggesting a need for localized marketing and service enhancements.


**Recommendations:**

1)Implement dynamic pricing models to adjust rates based on demand and reduce cancellations.
2)Offer promotional discounts for Resort Hotels on weekends and holidays to attract more bookings.
3)Launch seasonal marketing campaigns in January to counteract the high cancellation trend.
4)Enhance service quality and customer experience in high-cancellation regions, particularly Portugal, to improve retention.
5)Encourage direct bookings by offering loyalty rewards and exclusive discounts to reduce dependency on third-party platforms.


**Conclusion:**

By leveraging data analytics, this project provides actionable insights into hotel booking behaviors and cancellation patterns. Implementing the recommended strategies can help hotels optimize revenue, improve customer retention, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
